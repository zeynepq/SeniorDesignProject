# SeniorDesignProject

This project is the Senior Design Project of Zeynep Sari & Yagmur Catak.

This project is an example of biology lessons, cell division (meiosis-mitosis division) as a sample course with the help of Android software devices in 3-D with the help of visual software, and thus to make students love this course is a study to make it easier to learn.

Separate card designs were made for each cell division. There are 3D pictures in the mobile application, there are descriptions and two-dimensional pictures on the cards. When the user brings the camera of the device on the card, the 3D image overlaps the 2D image.

AR (Augmented Reality) was used in the project.
